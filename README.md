In the "Code" folder you will find the code that creates the full database plus the sample file and the process that extracts from the full database the smaller files.
Note that if you want to create a new database you have to rerun the code in order as it appears in the code blocks.

In the "Extracted Files" folder you will find the files that were extracted from the current full database.

Finally, in the "Full Database files + Sample" folder you will find the full database files plus the sample file that contains a subset of 1,000 entries of the primary database.
